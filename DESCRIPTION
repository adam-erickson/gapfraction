Description: This package is designed for forestry applications. It includes
    functions for creating raw and fast-pit-free canopy height models (CHMs) that
    can be processed with included hierarchical variable-window and watershed
    segmentation tree crown detection functions. The package includes additional
    functions to estimate gap fraction (canopy closure), canopy cover, leaf area
    index (LAI), apparent clumping index, and a number of other canopy metrics.
    Finally, the package includes four common camera models used in hemispherical
    photography.
