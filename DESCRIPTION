Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Adam", "Erickson", email = "adam.erickson@ubc.ca", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package is designed for forestry applications. It includes
    functions for creating raw and fast-pit-free canopy height models (CHMs) that
    can be processed with included hierarchical variable-window and watershed
    segmentation tree crown detection functions. The package includes additional
    functions to estimate gap fraction (canopy closure), fractional canopy cover,
    leaf area index (LAI), apparent clumping index, and a number of other canopy
    metrics. The package includes four common lens models used in hemispherical
    photography, as well as functions for plotting.
