Description: This package is designed for forestry applications. It includes functions for creating raw and fast-pit-free canopy height models (CHMs) that can be processed with included hierarchical variable-window and watershed segmentation tree crown detection functions. The package includes additional functions to estimate gap fraction (canopy closure), canopy cover, leaf area index (LAI), apparent clumping index, and a number of other canopy metrics. Finally, the package includes four common camera models used in hemispherical photography.
